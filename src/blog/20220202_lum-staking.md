# LUM Staking: Benefits & Risks 
Although crypto staking can bring you some passive income, you cannot ignore the risks. 
Let us look at some of the benefits and risks of staking your Lum tokens.

## Benefits:
### a. Easy Way to Earn Interest
LUM staking is an easy way of making some passive income. If you are holding any crypto as a long-term investment, the best way to make some money from it is by staking them with a quality validator. Staking won't make you lose your crypto; instead, it will bring you good returns.

### b. No Equipment Required
One of the most significant benefits of crypto staking is no requirement of any equipment like you would require for mining. You can simply find a good delegator and that is enough to make money out of it.

### c. Better than Mining In Terms of Environment
Staking, unlike mining, is more environment friendly and less costly. You don't need any high-end machinery for staking your crypto, which means less budget and no environmental pollution.

## Risks:
Bear in mind that staking risks exist, including risks associated with validator outage and double-signing. Additionally, users must wait 21 days before un-staking LUM from the network. Users will be unable to withdraw funds or receive points during this period.

### a. Price Drop May Vanish Your Interests
Crypto is considered the most volatile form of the digital asset in the world. The prices keep varying within a short span of time. This means an extreme price drop might vanish most of your profits. So, you need to be aware of that and stake it accordingly.

### b. Locked Tokens
Another considerable risk of staking your crypto is the locked tokens. You might not be allowed to un-stake the coins for a specific period even if the prices are going down and you are willing to sell them.

### c. No Quick Un-staking 
The un-staking time for LUM is 21 days. This means once you stake your coins with any delegator, you won't be able to un-stake them no matter the situation. This brings some vast risks as the prices might vary at a fast pace, which can result in some losses.

## LUM Staking: In a Nutshell
LUM staking allows the delegators to receive rewards from their tokens in exchange for their service/help to protect the network's protocol. These rewards originate from the network's transaction fees plus tokens released to stakers owing to the network's inflationary reward strategy. Once the reward is earned, users can opt to withdraw or compound earned incentives on a per-block basis.
However, the staking process works in a simple way.
Validators simply run nodes that are accountable for safeguarding any protocol's operations and provide staking rewards to the token holder. This way, the person who stakes their token is supplied with some passive income. However, the account holder won't be allowed to un-stake the tokens before 21 days.
