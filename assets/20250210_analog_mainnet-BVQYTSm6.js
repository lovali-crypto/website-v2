**Lovali Validator is proud to announce its participation in Analog Network’s Phase 3 Incentivized Testnet**, a pivotal initiative driving the future of blockchain interoperability. As Analog prepares for its **Token Generation Event (TGE) on February 10, 2025**, we are excited to share how users can engage with our node to stake $ANLOG tokens and earn rewards in this groundbreaking ecosystem.

### **Lovali’s Role in Analog’s Testnet & Mainnet**  
1. **Phase 3 Testnet Participation**  
   Lovali has been selected as a **whitelisted Time Node operator** in Chapter 1 of Analog’s Testnet Phase 3, contributing to network resilience and performance testing. By maintaining high uptime and completing validator quests, we’re helping secure the Timechain—Analog’s Substrate-based interoperability backbone—while earning a share of the **2% ANLOG token airdrop allocation**.  

2. **Mainnet Support Post-TGE**  
   Following the successful **mainnet launch on December 23, 2024**, Analog will transition to a **Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)** consensus. Lovali will operate as a Time Node, enabling users to stake $ANLOG tokens with us to earn yields from block production and cross-chain validation activities.

### **Analog’s TGE: What You Need to Know**

- **Token Utility**: $ANLOG powers staking, governance, and fee payments on Analog’s Timechain.  
- **Staking Rewards**: Time Nodes like Lovali will earn **8% annualized yields** initially, adjustable via on-chain governance.  
- **Post-TGE Upgrades**: Cross-chain messaging, data queries, and Chronicle Node functionalities will roll out, enhancing Analog’s interoperability toolkit.
